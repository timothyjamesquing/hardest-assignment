New roles - My new role is to help my classmates in our assignments from what i'ved learned from my another classmate. I just pass the knowledge to another so he/she can share it to another.
New routines - My new routine is waking up every 4 or 5 o' clock in the morning taking a bath 30 minutes waking up our helper to cook my food. Not like in highschool I wake up 6 am and it depends if I wake up 2 days a week or 3 because I exchange the day of waking up with my younger brother and I bath 2-3 minutes.
New relationship - My new relationship is my new friends that I see and communicate everyday and my new teachers or professors that I will be listening for years.
New assumption - My new assumption is to make and early income when studying so I can buy what I want and I will be dealing with my classmate in highschool who is now taking an I.T course after we graduate.

I want to create a 3d game and the genre of it is action,adventure,role-playing,fantasy,sci-fi, and the protagonist uses a giant blade and a double pistol, and the story of the game starts when the protagonist joins a group of people that fights an evil rich scientist that wants to conquer the whole universe with his diabolical monster. I realy want to make or have a game like that.
But before that I need to pass the 1st yr of my degree,and to do that I need to study hard and work hard to pass and get a higher grade in every sem.
